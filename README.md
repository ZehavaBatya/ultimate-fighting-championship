## EDA 
### Extensive EDA ðŸ”Ž
Ranges of values, missing values, analysis of target variable, feature importance analysis

### Operations Performed:
1. Data Cleaning and Handling:
Removed columns with more than 50% missing values: 'reach_in_cm'.
Converted 'date_of_birth' to a datetime data type.
Dropped rows with missing values in key columns ('name', 'nickname', 'stance', 'date_of_birth').

2. Data Exploration:
Computed summary statistics for numeric columns.
Checked the distribution and statistics for each numeric column.
Explored the distribution of wins using a histogram.

3. Data Transformation:
Created a log-transformed wins column to handle the right-skewed distribution.
Normalized numeric columns using Min-Max scaling.
Calculated the correlation matrix between numeric features.
### Reasoning:
Log Transformation: Log transformation is applied to handle right-skewed data distributions, promoting better model performance when applicable.

Data Cleaning: Removing columns with a significant number of missing values ensures a cleaner dataset, and dropping rows with missing values in key columns maintains the integrity of critical information.

EDA Techniques: Summary statistics and visualizations (histograms) are chosen to understand the distribution, central tendency, and potential outliers in the numeric columns.

Normalization: Scaling numeric columns is essential for models that are sensitive to the scale of features, ensuring fair treatment to all variables.

Correlation Analysis: Understanding correlations helps identify potential multicollinearity issues and guides feature selection.

Word Cloud: Word clouds provide an intuitive and visual representation of the most frequent terms, which can be valuable in identifying patterns or trends, especially in text data like nicknames. It's a creative way to highlight popular aliases associated with fighters.

## Model Training
1. Logistic Regression Model
Binary Outcome:

Logistic regression is particularly well-suited for binary classification problems, where the outcome variable has two possible classes. In MMA, one might be interested in predicting outcomes such as whether a fighter wins or loses a match. Logistic regression models the probability of the binary outcome, making it a natural choice for this type of prediction.
Interpretability:

Logistic regression provides interpretable results. The coefficients in logistic regression represent the log-odds of the outcome. This makes it easy to understand the impact of each predictor variable on the probability of the event occurring. In the context of MMA, one can interpret how different fighter characteristics or match statistics contribute to the likelihood of winning a fight.
Efficiency with Limited Data:

Logistic regression tends to perform well when the dataset is not extremely large. If one has a moderate-sized dataset, logistic regression can provide robust results without requiring a massive amount of data. This efficiency can be advantageous, especially if one is working with limited resources or collecting data on MMA matches, which may not be as abundant as data in some other domains.

2. Decision Tree Model 

Interpretability:

Decision trees offer a highly interpretable representation of decision-making processes. The model is essentially a tree-like flowchart where each node represents a decision based on a specific feature. This makes it easy to understand how the model arrives at a particular prediction. In projects related to MMA, interpretability can be crucial for gaining insights into which features or factors contribute most to predicting outcomes.
Handling Non-linearity and Interaction:

Decision trees are capable of capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between variables. In MMA, where the outcome of a match can depend on complex interactions between fighter attributes or match statistics, decision trees can be more flexible in capturing these patterns compared to linear models. They can identify intricate relationships that might be missed by simpler models.
Feature Importance:

Decision trees provide a natural way to assess the importance of different features in making predictions. By evaluating the splits in the tree, one can identify which features are most influential in determining outcomes. For a project related to MMA, understanding the importance of various fighter characteristics or match statistics can offer valuable insights into what makes a difference in winning or losing a fight.
